## Welcome to TyphonJS-FVTT

We provide next-gen tooling for the [Foundry VTT](https://foundryvtt.com/) developer community and release a collection of modules aimed at making open world style campaign management easier in Foundry. Please come join us on Discord on the [TyphonJS server](https://discord.gg/mnbgN8f) to chat about Foundry VTT development and our open world modules.
Be sure to signup for various roles for topics you are interested in such as: `developer` & `quest-log` to keep updated topics that interest you.

The premiere open world module we provide is the [TyphonJS quest log (TQL)](https://github.com/typhonjs-fvtt/typhonjs-quest-log) allowing GM & players to organize the campaign questing experience.

If you are a developer please see the following organizations:
- [typhonjs-fvtt-demo](https://github.com/typhonjs-fvtt-demo) for various demo repos and templates using TyphonJS FVTT libraries.
- [typhonjs-fvtt-lib](https://github.com/typhonjs-fvtt-lib) for the various developer library repo resources.

The [TyphonJS Runtime Library](https://github.com/typhonjs-fvtt-lib/typhonjs) is the main developer resource available. It provides an augmented [Svelte](https://svelte.dev/) runtime optimized for Foundry VTT with great integration into the standard Application lifecycle that all 3rd party developers are already familiar with using.
