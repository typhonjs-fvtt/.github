## Welcome to TyphonJS-FVTT

We provide next-gen tooling for the [Foundry VTT](https://foundryvtt.com/) developer community and release a collection of modules aimed at making open world style campaign management easier in Foundry. Please come join us on Discord on the [![Discord](https://img.shields.io/discord/737953117999726592?label=TyphonJS&style=plastic)](https://discord.gg/mnbgN8f) server to chat about Foundry VTT development and our open world modules.
Be sure to signup for various roles for topics you are interested in such as: `Developer` & `Quest Giver` to keep updated on topics that interest you.

The premiere open world module we provide is the [TyphonJS Quest Log (TQL)](https://github.com/typhonjs-fvtt/typhonjs-quest-log) allowing GM & players to organize the campaign questing experience.

If you are a developer please see the following organizations:
- [typhonjs-fvtt-demo](https://github.com/typhonjs-fvtt-demo) for various demo repos and templates using TyphonJS FVTT libraries.
- [typhonjs-fvtt-lib](https://github.com/typhonjs-fvtt-lib) for the various developer library repo resources.

The [TyphonJS Runtime Library](https://github.com/typhonjs-fvtt-lib/typhonjs) is the main developer resource available. It provides an augmented [Svelte](https://svelte.dev/) runtime optimized for Foundry VTT with great integration into the standard Application lifecycle that all 3rd party developers are already familiar with using in addition to several additional resources to supercharge your development experience.
